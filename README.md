The purpose of Usability Testing is to improve the usability of a product. Through UT, we can observe representative end users using the product to perform realistic tasks while collecting empirical data. UT allows us to see how useful and satisfactory design is, inspect for frustrating aspects, and improve profitability. Through my UT of drugs.com, I wanted to test how easy it was to navigate and find information. One big flaw about I found about the website is that the information provided is not very organized. I also feel like a lot of functions are hidden or hard to see on the front page and subsequent pages. Especially for people who have never navigated the website before, it seemed hard to find specific information quickly and effortlessly. So for the UT, I tested to see how easy the participant felt like it was to find specific information that might be harder to see.
